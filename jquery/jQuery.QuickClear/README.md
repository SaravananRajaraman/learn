==Jquery QuickClear Plugin

QuickClear is a simple jQuery plugin to help you quickly clear the values of an input field or text area.

Plugin displays a delete button on hover and focus of an input field and allows you to bypass the tedious 
task of pounding the delete or backspace button.  I originally developed it to be used on interfaces that
require time sensitive tasks such as call centers and financial apps.
